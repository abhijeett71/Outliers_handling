**Detecting Outliers**

If our dataset is small, we can detect the outlier by just looking at the dataset. But what if we have a huge dataset, how do we identify the outliers then? We need to use visualization and mathematical techniques.

**Below are some of the techniques of detecting outliers**

- Boxplots
- Z-score
- Inter Quantile Range(IQR)
